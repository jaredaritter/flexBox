# Application of flexbox lesson

## Simple example of different justify-content types

* Used defaults of flex-direction: row and align-items: stretch.
    * Fair understanding of main axis modifications
    * Will benefit from continued time working with cross axis modifications and will need to look for practical use cases
* Future upgrade:
    * Would like to add DOM manipulation to create buttons to modify CSS on single example element similar to MDN style docs.
* Difficulties:
    * Alignment of h2 elements into flow awkward and unable to create desired idea at this time without spending too much time on side topic. 
    * Continued practice and use of positioning abilities needed.
